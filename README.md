# Alexa-Skill-Clothing-Suggestion-front-and-back-end

I work with Wenlin Gong in Weather Hack powered by the NYS Mesonet at the University at Albany. I upload the same file in her repository and mine for easier coperation and management. In this event, I was mainly in charge of the front end on Alexa Developer Console and the back end run on Lambda. The program is still under testing and it only supports the area in New York state.
